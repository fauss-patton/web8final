            <h2>Skiing</h2>
            <p>
                My entire family are skiiers, my dad grew up skiing with his parents, as did my Mom, and they introduced me and my twin brother to it when we were just two years old. We all have grown to be quite competent skiiers, and enjoy it most weekends of winter.

            <h2>Sailing</h2>
            <p>
               My Dad grew up sailing, his parents had a 36 foot sloop, <i>Shogun</i>, and later aquired our 42 foot sloop <i>True Love</i>, which my twin brother and I grew up crewing. Our whole family takes multiple weeklong and weekend sailing trips in the summer and fall, sailing someimes just across the Puget sound to Poulsbo Harbor, or up through the Strait of Juan De Fuca to the San Juan Islands, or even further north to Canada, harboring in Vancouver and Victoria. Sailing is an important part of our families fun and have enjoyed it for years.

            <p>
                In addition to playing pick-up basketball most wednsdays and fridays, I have also played basketball for my school team for four years and plan to continue in high school.

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>
                I have played rec league soccer for my local team, as well as doing summer camps, for as long as I can remember. I have also played for my school team for four years. Unfortunatley, there is a chance I do not play in highschool.
