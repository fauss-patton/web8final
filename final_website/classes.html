        My Three Favorite Classes This Trimester
    </h1>
    <p>
        Eastside Prep is a fantastic school, and I have loved attending 8th grade here. These were my three favorite classes this trimester.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Historical Thinking 3</h2>
            <p>
                In this class, we have done a year-long unit on world religion, exploring the cultures, faiths, and beliefs of the six largest world religions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Bhuddism, Sikhism, and Judiasm. I have loved learning about the similarities and differences of these beautiful belief systems, and it has been fun to notice trends and insights into what shapes these faiths and how it impacts their societies. My teacher, Mr. Yezbick, is very knowledgable about our topics and is good at leading fun class discussions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Scientific Thinking 3</h2>
            <p>
                In this class, we have covered astronomy, geology, and a little bit of oceanography and meterology, as well as general lab work, the electromagnetic spectrum, energy transfer, and states of matter. I had fun playing with fire to learn about how different elements release different types of photons when burning to emmit different lights. burning copper releases a cool <span style="color: lightseagreen;">Green-Blue Fame.</span> My teacher, Mr. Barrager, is fun and interesting in class even if he sometimes assigns too much work.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>WEB</h2>
            <p>
                I didn't put this in just because this is a WEB assignment, I genuinley have had fun in this class. This has been my first real experience with coding, and it has been great to explore this new area with my freinds. I find coding very interesting, and I have way more fun doing work in this class than the average work of most other classes. It is a welcome break from the monotony of annotating some book or filling out some worksheet.
